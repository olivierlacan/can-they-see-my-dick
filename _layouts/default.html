          <dd>
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> The FISA amendments act of 2008 which section 702 falls under allows the bulk collection of Internet communications that are one-end foreign. If you have your email somewhere like Gmail, it's hosted on servers overseas or transfered overseas or anytime crosses over the borders of the United States: your junk ends up in the database.
            </p>

            <p>You don't have to be sending your dick to a German. Even if you send it to somebody within the United States your — wholly domestic — communication between you and your wife can go from New York to London and back and get caught up in the database.</p>

          <dd>
            <p><strong>Yes.</strong> EO 12333 is what the NSA uses when the other authorities aren't aggressive enough or they're not catching as much as they'd like.</p>

            <p>When you send your junk through Gmail for example: that's stored on Google's servers. Google moves data from datacenter to datacenter — invisibly to you, without your knowledge. Your data could be moved outside of the borders of the United States temporarily when your junk was passed by Gmail the NSA caught a copy of that.</p>

            <p>PRISM is how they <strong>pull your junk out</strong> of Google with Google's involvement.</p>
            <p>All of the different PRISM partners — people like Yahoo, Facebook, Google — the government deputizes them to be sort of their little surveillance Sheriffs. They're a Dick Sheriff.</p>

            <p><strong>If you're describing your junk on the phone: yes</strong>. They have the content as well as the duration but only for a few countries. If you're in vacation in the Bahamas, they know what your junk looks like.</p>

            <p><strong>No dick pic.</strong> But they can probably tell who you're sharing your junk pictures with because they're seeing who you're texting with, who you're calling. </p>
